**problem 1** -
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

**problem-2**
There are numBottles water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange numExchange empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.
The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.
Given the two integers numBottles and numExchange, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.
Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.
